name_of_satellite_alternate_names,"Name of Satellite, Alternate Names",identifier,0,,,char,,,"The current or most popularly used name is listed first, with alternate or previously used names given in parentheses. 
  A satellite can have several names during its operational lifetime, especially commercial satellites that are sold, leased, transferred as assets in business transactions, or simply used by more than one user. 
  U.S. government intelligence satellites may be known by several names at the same time.  
A search of this column using the name familiar to you should locate the satellite."
current_official_name_of_satellite,Current Official Name of Satellite,identifier,0,,,char,,,"This column contains only the official name of the satellite in the case of government and military satellites, and the most commonly used name in the case of commercial and civil satellites."

  “NR” indicates that the satellite has never been registered with the United Nations. 
  “NR (xx/xx)” indicates a recently launched satellite that as of that date has not been registered with the United Nations. 
  As the ownership and operational control of commercial satellites continues to become more complicated and rapidly changing, this column indicates the “launching state” as indicated in the Convention on Objects Launched into Outer Space."
country_of_operator_owner,Country of Operator/Owner,factor,0,,,char,,,"The home country identified with the operator/owner, i.e., the country that operates or owns the satellite or the home country of the business entity that does so. 
  If this includes three or fewer countries, each is listed; otherwise the project is simply designated as Multinational. 
  An exception to this is projects of the European Space Agency (ESA), which represent the joint efforts of its 15 member states and are designated as ESA."
operator_owner,Operator/Owner,factor,0,,,char,,,"The satellite’s current operational controller. 
  The operator is not necessarily the satellite’s owner, satellites may be leased, for example. 
"
users,Users,factor,0,,,char,,,"The affiliation of the primary users of the satellite is described with one or more of the keywords: civil (academic, amateur), commercial, government (meteorological, scientific, etc.), military. 
  Satellites can be multi-use, hosting, for example, dedicated transponders for both commercial and military applications."
purpose,Purpose,factor,0,,,char,,,"The discipline in which the satellite is used in broad categories. 
  The purposes listed are those self-reported by the satellite’s operator.

class_of_orbit,Class of Orbit,factor,0,,,char,,,"Satellite orbits are divided into two broad classes: 
  (1) nearly circular orbits (LEO, MEO, GEO) and 
  (2) elliptical orbits. 
Satellites in elliptical orbits have apogees and perigees that differ significantly from each other and they spend time at many different altitudes above the earth’s surface. 
  Satellite orbits with eccentricity less than 0.14 are categorised as nearly circular, and those with eccentricity 0.14 and higher as elliptical."
type_of_orbit,Type of Orbit,factor,0,,,char,,,"Nearly Circular Orbits are classified:
  Equatorial—low earth equatorial orbit, with inclination between 0º and 20º
  Nonpolar Inclined—low earth intermediate orbit, with inclination between 20º and 85º
  Polar—low earth polar orbit, with inclination between 85º and 95º and greater than 104º
  Sun-synchronous—low earth sun-synchronous orbit, with inclination approximately between 95º and 104º, with sun-synchronous relationship between altitude and inclination"
longitude_of_geo_degrees,Longitude of GEO (degrees),measure,0,2,1,decimal,#7ae7bf,#0f533a,"For satellites that are in geosynchronous orbits, this is the earth longitude of the point over which the satellite sits, in degrees. A “+” indicates longitude east of 0º (Greenwich) and a “-“ indicates longitude west. 
  The column is blank for satellites in non-GEO orbits. "
perigee_km,Perigee (km),measure,0,0,100,decimal,#e7bf7a,#533a0f,"The altitude above the Earth’s surface of the satellite’s perigee, which is the point of the orbit closest to the Earth’s center of mass, given in kilometers."
apogee_km,Apogee (km),measure,0,0,100,decimal,#e7bf7a,#533a0f,"The altitude above the Earth’s surface of the satellite’s apogee, which is the point of the orbit farthest from the Earth’s center of mass, given in kilometers. "
eccentricity,Eccentricity (%),measure,0,1,0.01,percent,#7ae7bf,#0f533a,"The eccentricity of a satellite’s orbit describes how strongly the orbit deviates from a circle. 
  An orbit with eccentricity of zero is a circle. "
inclination_degrees,Inclination (degrees),measure,0,2,1,decimal,#7ae7bf,#0f533a,"The angle between the orbital plane of the satellite and equatorial plane of the Earth, measured in degrees."
period_minutes,Period (minutes),measure,0,1,1,decimal,#d9e77a,#4a530f,"The time required for the satellite to complete one full orbit of the Earth, given in minutes."
launch_mass_kg,Launch Mass (kg.),measure,0,0,1,decimal,#7aa2e7,#2e3b53,"The mass of the satellite at the time of launch, including fuel, given in kilograms."
dry_mass_kg,Dry Mass (kg.),measure,0,0,1,decimal,#7aa2e7,#2e3b53,"The mass of the satellite without fuel, measured in kilograms. In some cases the primary source indicates explicitly that this mass refers to the beginning of the satellite’s life, after the satellite has been placed in its assigned orbit, and therefore apparently excludes kick motors, etc. 
These cases are indicated by “(BOL)” following the entry."
power_watts,Power (watts),measure,0,0,10,decimal,#e7897a,#53180f,"The amount of useable electric power produced by the satellite, often by solar panels, given in watts. 
  The power produced typically decreases over time; a number followed by “(BOL)” or “(EOL)” refers to the level of power generated near the beginning or end, respectively, of the satellite’s planned lifetime. "
date_of_launch,Date of Launch,date,0,,365,date,#d9e77a,#4a530f,The date of launch.
expected_lifetime_yrs,Expected Lifetime (yrs.),measure,0,2,1,decimal,#d9e77a,#4a530f,"The planned operational lifetime of the satellite, given in years. 
  This figure is reported by the satellite’s operator and may be based on the expected failure rate for the hardware and software of the satellite, the fuel capacity of the satellite and the expected requirements for maneuvering and stationkeeping (many satellites run out of fuel long before their hardware and software wear out), the planned budget for operating the satellite, and the expected availability of improved
future generation satellites. 
  This figure can be misleading, especially in terms of scientific satellites. 
  For example, the Akebono satellite, launched in 1989 with a design life of one year, is still functioning in 2009."
contractor,Contractor,factor,0,,,char,,,"The prime contractor for the satellite’s construction. The construction of satellites generally involves a number of subcontractors as well. 
  Frequent corporate mergers mean that the name listed as the prime contractor may not be the name of that corporation today. 
  In creating the database, we listed what was shown on the company or agency’s website at the time the database was originally constructed. 
(These will not necessarily be updated with each new version of the database)."

cospar_number,COSPAR Number,identifier,0,,,char,,,"The COSPAR number is the international designation assigned by the Committee on Space Research (COSPAR) to each object launched into space. Names of satellites often change, but this number remains constant. 
  The number reflects the year of the launch and sequence of launch within that year. 
  For example, a COSPAR number of 1998-063B would indicate that the satellite was launched in 1998, and that it was on the 63rd successful launch of that year. 
  The “B” indicates that the given satellite was the second object catalogued from that launch."
norad_number,NORAD Number,identifier,0,,,char,,,"The NORAD number is the five-digit number assigned by the North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) for each satellite in their catalogue. 
  The number is assigned when an object is first observed, and remains with the object throughout its existence. "
